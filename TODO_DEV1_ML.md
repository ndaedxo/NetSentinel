## Coordination Points

### Daily Sync (15 minutes)
- **Time**: 9:00 AM
- **Topics**: Test results, blocking issues, integration points
- **Attendees**: All 3 developers

### Files to Avoid
```
❌ Dev 2's files: websocket_*, event_bus.py
❌ Dev 3's files: security/*, auth endpoints in api_server.py
✅ Your files: ml_*, tests/*ml*, tests/*feature*
```
