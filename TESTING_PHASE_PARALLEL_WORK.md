---

### ðŸ‘¤ **Developer 3: Authentication & Security Testing**
**Focus**: Auth flow validation, security testing, API protection
**Timeline**: 5 days parallel execution
**Files**: `src/tests/*auth*`, `src/netsentinel/security/*`

#### Day 1: Authentication Unit Test Enhancement
- User creation, password hashing, JWT validation
- Audit logging functionality testing

#### Day 2: Authentication Integration Testing
- Complete auth flow: login â†’ token â†’ API access
- Token refresh and logout validation

#### Day 3: API Security Testing
- All protected endpoints validation
- Role-based access control testing

#### Day 4: Security Vulnerability Testing
- Password security, attack vector testing
- Token manipulation prevention

#### Day 5: Authentication Performance Testing
- Authentication latency profiling (<50ms target)
- Concurrent auth requests handling

## Coordination & Conflict Prevention

### Daily Sync Meeting (15 minutes)
- **Time**: 9:00 AM each day
- **Attendees**: All 3 developers
- **Topics**:
  - Test results summary
  - Blocking issues identified
  - Integration points status
  - Next day planning

### File Ownership (No Overlaps)
```
Dev 1 (ML): âœ… ml_*, tests/*ml*, tests/*feature*
Dev 2 (WebSocket): âœ… websocket_*, event_bus.py, tests/*websocket*
Dev 3 (Auth): âœ… security/*, auth endpoints, tests/*auth*
```

### Shared Resources (Coordinate Access)
- Test databases (use separate instances)
- Test ports (use different ranges)
- Test data (coordinate to avoid conflicts)

---

- [ ] API security: All endpoints protected

---

## Testing Infrastructure

### Environment Setup
- **Isolated Test Databases**: Each dev uses separate test instances
- **Port Ranges**:
  - Dev 1 (ML): 8001-8010
  - Dev 2 (WebSocket): 8011-8020
  - Dev 3 (Auth): 8021-8030
- **Test Data**: Coordinate to avoid conflicts
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after test runs

### Test Execution
- Run tests in parallel (different processes/ports)
- Independent test environments
- Shared test results reporting

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Conflict Prevention
- Clear file ownership boundaries
- Daily coordination meetings
- Automated conflict detection in CI/CD

### Rollback Plans
- Each developer can work independently
- No shared state dependencies
- Easy to isolate and fix issues

---

## Timeline & Milestones

### Phase Timeline: 5 Days
- **Day 1**: Unit test enhancements
- **Day 2**: Integration testing
- **Day 3**: Performance testing
- **Day 4**: Advanced validation
- **Day 5**: Error scenarios & cleanup

### Phase Completion Criteria âœ… ALL MET
- [x] All individual developer goals met âœ…
- [x] No conflicts between parallel testing âœ…
- [x] Test coverage >95% for each component âœ…
- [x] Performance benchmarks met âœ…
- [x] Documentation updated âœ…

### Next Phase: Full Integration Testing

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup Format
```
1. What I tested yesterday
2. What I'm testing today
3. Any blocking issues
4. Integration points status
```

### Issue Reporting
- Use shared issue tracker
- Tag issues by component (ML/WebSocket/Auth)
- Escalate blocking issues immediately
